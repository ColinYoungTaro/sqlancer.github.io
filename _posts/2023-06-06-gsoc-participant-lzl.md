## Could you introduce yourself?

My name is Zhenglin. I am currently a senior year undergraduate student majoring in software engineering at SCU.

I have been accepted for graduate studies at TAMU, starting 23 fall, where I will be specializing in computer science.

I have a strong passion for open source projects. I have actively contributed to several projects, including SQLancer, Casbin, Beam, and so on.

## What will you be working on as part of your GSoC project?

As part of my GSoC project, my primary focus will be on enhancing SQLancer to support a new database system called StoneDB.

This will involve various tasks, such as integrating support for the new DBMS, testing the system, identifying, validating, and reporting bugs or issues found.

## How did you hear about GSoC and SQLancer?

I first learned about the Google Summer of Code program approximately three years ago through a video platform called bilibili. In my opinion, GSoC will provid me with a great opportunity to delve into the world of open source and make valuable contributions under the mentorship of experienced individuals.

In the case of SQLancer, I discovered it while browsing through the list of organizations participating in GSoC. I found SQLancer interesting. Also, SQLancer is useful and it has uncovered numerous bugs in well-established DBMS.

## What will you do after the project?

After completing my GSoC project, my plan is to continue actively contributing to SQLancer and other open source community. I believe in the power of open source software because it is transformative.

Looking ahead, I will be starting my graduate studies at Texas A&M University. The program I am attending is Master of Computer Science. After this, I plan to seek employment in the tech companies, building software that interests me, excites me, and impact people.

For the first time, SQLancer is participating as a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/sqlancer) organization. We are excited that we will be working with two contributors: [Zhenglin Li](https://github.com/HT-Tomas) and [Yutan Yang](https://github.com/ColinYoungTaro). Find out more about them below!


# Yutan Yang

## Could you introduce yourself?

Hello, I'm Yutan Yang, a first-year master's student at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. 
I am interested in coding since I find it interesting to bring ideas to life through programming.
Aside from coding, I also enjoy drawing while I may not consider myself an expert.

## What will you be working on as part of your GSoC project?

As part of my GSoC project, I will be working on implementing test case reduction approaches.

 SQLancer automatically generates thousands of statements and it might be complicated to identify which is relevant to the bug. The reduction process removes statements and tokens which are irrelevant to bugs so that the test case could be simple and clear.  Additionally, I aim to extend these reduction approaches to support more DBMSs.

## How did you hear about GSoC and SQLancer?

I first learned about GSoC through recommendations from one of my friends, and I think contributing to open-source projects is cool.

I came across SQLancer when exploring Program Organizations listed on the GSoC website. Recognizing that the idea is related to my graduate research topic, I decided to apply for it.

## What will you do after the project?

I might keep on contributing to open-source projects. I hope this experience will allow me to gain engineering experience and collaboration skills.

I would first continue my study. After successfully completing my master's degree, I am excited to transition into the professional world and pursue opportunities in the IT industry.

# Zhenglin Li

## Could you introduce yourself?

My name is Zhenglin Li. I am currently a senior year undergraduate student majoring in software engineering at SCU.
I have been accepted for graduate studies at TAMU, starting 23 fall, where I will be specializing in computer science.
I have a strong passion for open source projects. I have actively contributed to several projects, including SQLancer, Casbin, Beam, and so on.

## What will you be working on as part of your GSoC project?

As part of my GSoC project, my primary focus will be on enhancing SQLancer to support a new database system called StoneDB.
This will involve various tasks, such as integrating support for the new DBMS, testing the system, identifying, validating, and reporting bugs or issues found.

## How did you hear about GSoC and SQLancer?

I first learned about the Google Summer of Code program approximately three years ago through a video platform called bilibili. In my opinion, GSoC will provid me with a great opportunity to delve into the world of open source and make valuable contributions under the mentorship of experienced individuals.

In the case of SQLancer, I discovered it while browsing through the list of organizations participating in GSoC. I found SQLancer interesting. Also, SQLancer is useful and it has uncovered numerous bugs in well-established DBMS.

## What will you do after the project?

After completing my GSoC project, my plan is to continue actively contributing to SQLancer and other open source community. I believe in the power of open source software because it is transformative.

Looking ahead, I will be starting my graduate studies at Texas A&M University. The program I am attending is Master of Computer Science. After this, I plan to seek employment in the tech companies, building software that interests me, excites me, and impact people.

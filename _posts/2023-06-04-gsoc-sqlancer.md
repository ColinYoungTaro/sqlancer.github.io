For the first time, SQLancer will participate as a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/sqlancer) organization. We are excited that we will be working with two contributors: [Zhenglin](https://github.com/HT-Tomas) and [Yutan Yang](https://github.com/ColinYoungTaro).

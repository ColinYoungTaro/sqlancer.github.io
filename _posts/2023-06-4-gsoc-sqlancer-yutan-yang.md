For the first time, SQLancer will participate as a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/sqlancer) organization. We are excited that we will be working with two contributors: [Zhenglin](https://github.com/HT-Tomas) and [Yutan Yang](https://github.com/ColinYoungTaro).


## Could you introduce yourself?

Hello, I'm Yutan Yang, a first-year master's student at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. 

I am interested in coding since I find it interesting to bring ideas to life through programming.

Aside from coding, I also enjoy drawing while I may not consider myself an expert.

## What will you be working on as part of your GSoC project?

As part of my GSoC project, I will be working on implementing test case reduction approaches.

 SQLancer automatically generates thousands of statements and it might be complicated to identify which is relevant to the bug. The reduction process removes statements and tokens which are irrelevant to bugs so that the test case could be simple and clear.  Additionally, I aim to extend these reduction approaches to support more DBMSs.

## How did you hear about GSoC and SQLancer?

I first learned about GSoC through recommendations from one of my friends, and I think contributing to open-source projects is cool.

I came across SQLancer when exploring Program Organizations listed on the GSoC website. Recognizing that the idea is related to my graduate research topic, I decided to apply for it.

## What will you do after the project?

I might keep on contributing to open-source projects. I hope this experience will allow me to gain engineering experience and collaboration skills.

I would first continue my study. After successfully completing my master's degree, I am excited to transition into the professional world and pursue opportunities in the IT industry.
